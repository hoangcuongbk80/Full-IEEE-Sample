In this article we propose a method for extracting grasp envelopes --- constraints on gripper pose and joint configurations --- from online reconstructed workspace models.
We utilize knowledge of basic human grasping strategies to define two grasp envelope primitives favoring grasps along the target object PCA directions. 
\par
A limitation of the current work is the lack of rigorous treatment of kinematic feasibility of the extracted envelopes.
Therefore, we plan to extend our approach using information of the likelihood of achieving grasp poses, $e.g.$ by using capability maps~\cite{Zach07}.
