As a comprehensive overview of data-driven grasp planning is beyond the scope of this work, we direct the interested reader to a recent survey by Bohg et al.~\cite{Bohg14} and only overview relevant approaches in constraint-based grasp representations.

In~\cite{Bere11}, TSRs are defined manually, while the main focus of our work is on extracting grasp envelopes in an automatic manner.
Our grasp envelopes can be seen as a generalization of TSRs with application to the grasping task, and can be readily integrated in the motion planning framework proposed by Berenson et al.

The second set of approaches closely related to our work focus on the task of locating grasping affordances in various perceptual sensor data: for example, RGB images~\cite{Saxe08} or point clouds~\cite{Pas13}.
While there is a vast body of literature on extracting candidate grasps from various sensing modalities, most works concentrate on finding a single grasping configuration.
